      <h2> Welcome to my webpage this is where i will be keeping myself up to date for the world to see. </h2>
      My name is <strong> Ty Frajkor </strong> and I am currently progressing through the game programing course in st.lawrence college.
      I've been told I have a nack for creating stories and worlds so i figured why not get the skills to transfer my nack into a interactable format.
      Among video games and writing i have done my own self studies into visual art, music, and animals a good bit of these self studies will also transfer to the development to future projects.
